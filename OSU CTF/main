Natasha Drew really wants to go to hacker camp but she doesn't have the grades. Hack into the OSUSEC student portal and give her all A's so she can go!

First test the login for injections.
'or 1=1# works and gets me in.

At first sight it looks like nothing can be done on the page but taking a look at the pages source, there is a linked js script.
assets/min/js/app.min.js
Taking a look at the script it seems like there is functionality for changing the students grades.
There is a check for s.admin and it seems like it's false by default.

Using a devtools debugger add a breakpoint on the check and change the value of s.admin to true from the console.
Now you can click on a name and change the grades.

There is still a problem, there is no Natasha Drew on the list...

Good thing is the form is submitted in /update-student/STUDENTS_FULL_NAME_ENCODED_WITH_B64

So some base64 encoding and grade changing later we get the flag.
